=============================
Summary
==========
First, I selected my 3 html files to modify. Some contain images, some do not. First, I removed all of the inline css in each HTML file so that it would not interfere with my custom css. I then added a link to my custom css in each files header. 

Summary of Style Changes:

body:
    - changed to a custom font (Tangerine) from Google Fonts that mimics 'Old-Fashioned' handwriting
    - changed the color of the background to a 'Antique White' color to make the doc look aged
    aligned all headers and non-paragraph text in the center of the page
    - added a margin around the page to mimic a page's margin

pre:
    - reduced font weight to 100
    - italicized the text

h1: 
    - changed the font to serif to make it more readable
    - first letter is 3x larger, has a border around it (double border)
    - italisized the font
    - increased margins
    
h2, h3, h4, h5, h6:
    - first letter is 3x larger, has a border around it (double border)
    - underline these headers

p:
    - align all text to the left, inherits all other text attributes from body
    
a:
    - font color changed to black

table:
    - increase the width to 100% so that tables can be centered

tr:
    - center table rows

img:
    - centered the images
    - got rid of borders
    - set the opacity to 50%, this gives it a faded appearance, which helps it look aged

hr:
    - changed the border to double
    - increased the width
    - changed color to black

When rendered in the CSS files, they create somewhat of an 'old-fashioned' look as specified in the assignment specs.Screenshots were captured and saved in the same directory as the HTML and CSS files in the Part1 directory of the repo.

Summary
==========
Basically, the two html files and their corresponding css files follow the assignment specs. One is ugly, one is slightly less ugly.
